<h1 style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;">What is Aeronautical Engineering</h1>
<p >Aeronautical engineering, often abbreviated as AE, is one of the most sought-after engineering courses in India
 after Electronics, Me Communicationchanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering.<br> Aeronautical Engineering involves designing,
 developing and manufacturing electronic equipment (for devices and circuits) as well as communication systems.<br> The degree in Electronics
 and Communication Engineering enables you with a clear understanding of analog transmission, basic electronics, microprocessors, 
 solid-state devices, digital analog communication, satellite communication, Integrated circuits, antennae and wave progression
 and microwave engineering.<br>
 There is a thin line between the Aeronautical Engineering course and Electrical Engineering (EE) course that people
 from outside the domain tend to not understand. <br> While Electrical Engineering (EE) is associated with large-scale electrical systems,
 Electronics engineering (AE) involves small-scale electronics systems.</p>
